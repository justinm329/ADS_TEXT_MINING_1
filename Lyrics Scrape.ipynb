    "\n",
    "The lyrics site, www.azlyrics.com, does not have an explicit maximum on number of requests in any one time, but in our testing it appears that too many requests in too short a time will cause the site to stop returning lyrics pages. (Entertainingly, the page that gets returned seems to only have the song title to [a Tom Jones song](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomjones/itsnotunusual.html).) \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you call `requests.get` to retrieve a page, put a `time.sleep(5 + 10*random.random())` on the next line. This will help you not to get blocked. If you _do_ get blocked, which you can identify if the returned pages are not correct, just request a lyrics page through your browser. You'll be asked to perform a CAPTCHA and then your requests should start working again. \n",

    "Q: Take a look at the `robots.txt` page on www.azlyrics.com. (You can read more about these pages [here](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro).) Is the scraping we are about to do allowed or disallowed by this page? How do you know? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: After looking over the robots.txt file for the website we are allowed teh scrap song lyric data from here. However it is important to note that we are not allowed to scrap data that has /lyricsdb/ or /song/ in the url and since we are building custom URLs with the artist name and song name we are allowed to scrap data from this website.\n"
