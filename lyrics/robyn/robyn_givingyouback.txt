In another timeAnother lifeIn another situation IWould have made you mineWould have taken timeTo make sure you'd be fineI could feel you comingI knew you wouldAnd I never imaginedYou'd be so goodAnd it hurts me soYo let you goI want you to liveBut I'm not all I wanna giveRight now, nothing can be rightRight now, nothing can be wrongAll I can do is keep believing[CHORUS]I'm giving you back, to the oceanI'm giving you back, to the starsI'm giving you back, to where you came from(I..)And I'm not forgetting who you areWith you in meI was beautifulTwo months of joyBefore the impossibleEvery second ILong for the dayWhen you come backCome back to stayWhen the time is rightWhen there's no wrongI'll be there for youAnd I'll be strongAnd I promise I'll beAll I can beI'm still openIf you still want meRight now, nothing can be wrong,Right now, nothing can be rightAll I can do is keep believing[Chorus (x1)]You made me see a lot clearerHeaven is not that farOne day I hope to be closerTo be as pure as I know thatI know that you are[Chorus (x2)]
