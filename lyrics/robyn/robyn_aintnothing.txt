[Verse 1:]Boy you gotta want me, really really want meBoy you gotta need me cause baby I can't get enough and II'm trying to catch the feeling of how we used to be andHow it used to feel back then[Chorus:]I'm saying that it ain't no thing for meBaby if it ain't no thing for youBut baby if is a thing for youThere'll be nothing for me and nothing for youSaid you might wanna write this down[Verse 2:]Boy you know i want you, really really want you, oh really need youBut I don't wanna pick up your socksAnd maybe it's a really silly thing but babyIt would just be nice to compromise
