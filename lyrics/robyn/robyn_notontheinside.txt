Isn't funny how some people never practice what the preachIsn't it sad that the strongest arm's still to short to reachI watch him struggle with the fact that he's become what he said he'll never beHip parties and sunglasses at night they help him not to seeCan he see?[CHORUS]He's been high on a young girls vibeNever alone on a saturday nightHe's been a around the world, about a million timesBut he's never been love, not on the insideIsn't so messed up to be witness for a man who won't confess,He won't confess, noThat he lost his truth, so caught up in believin' his own pressI watch him struggle with the fact that he relies on people that don't really care,They don't care, no no noYou say that the buisness is a whackSo baby why are you so deep in there[Chorus (x1)]One day it's gonna be to lateOr maybe it's to late, anywayFamous has made you shamelessBut not blamelessJust loveless, loveless, loveless[Chorus (x2)]
