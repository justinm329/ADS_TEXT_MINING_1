Oh baby no, don't you go, let them waitOh baby no, don't you go, baby stay...[Verse 1:]Don't know the time but I feel you're getting out of bedThe way you felt last night I wanna feel it againOh baby no, don't you go, let them waitBaby don't leave me alone, please stay[Chorus:]Through the moonlight, sunshineWe can go on and on, I'll be holding you closeThrough the moonlight, sunshineHere in a world of our ownBaby don't go[Verse 2:]You say you've got things to do gotta get on with your dayI say but think of the things we could do if you stayedNo I don't wanna be on my ownBaby don't leave your baby alone
