[VERSE 1]She needs a place to rest her broken soulLongs for a place where love is goodHer passion for him made her heart boldShe sacrificed her womanhoodLove made her brave but oh so vulnerableBut still she keeps on holding onSome say she's weak, I say she's beautifulHer weakness prooves that she is strong[CHORUS]She's a universal womanAnd she lives inside of youShe's a universal womanAnd love is all she can doShe lost her spirit when she lost her childTo what society demandsAnd all the children and the mother cried'Cause nature can not understandBut everytime she dies she's born againTrue love never just goes awayJust like her sacrifice is not in vain'Cause she will allways prevail[Chorus (x1)][Verse 1 (x1)][Chorus (x1)]Yeah loveLove
