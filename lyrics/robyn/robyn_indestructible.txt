I'm going backwards through time at the speed of lightI'm yours, you're mineTwo satellitesNot aloneNo, we're not aloneA freeze-frame of your eye in the strobe lightSweat dripping down from your browHold tightDon't let goDon't you let me goAnd I never was smart with loveI let the bad ones in and the good ones goBut I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt beforeI'm gonna love you like I'm indestructibleYour love is ultramagneticAnd it's taking overThis is hardcoreAnd I'm indestructibleHands up in the air like we don't careWe're shooting deep into spaceAnd the lasers split the darkCut right through the darkIt's just us. We ignore the crowd dancingFall to the floorBeats in my heartPut your hands on my heartAnd I never was smart with loveI let the bad ones in and the good ones goBut I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt beforeI'm gonna love you like I'm indestructibleYour love is ultramagneticAnd it's taking overThis is hardcoreOoh and I'm gonna love you likeI'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt beforeI'm gonna love you like I'm indestructibleYour love is ultramagneticAnd it's taking overThis is hardcoreAnd I'm indestructibleAnd I never was smart with loveI let the bad ones in and the good ones goBut I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt beforeI'm gonna love you like I'm indestructibleYour love is ultramagneticAnd it's taking overThis is hardcoreOoh and I'm gonna love you likeI'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt beforeI'm gonna love you like I'm indestructibleYour love is ultramagneticAnd it's taking overThis is hardcoreAnd I'm indestructible
