[Chorus:]O baby you're making that mistake again oh whyO don't you understand, everytime you do you make me cryI see those tears and it hurts so much each time you say you're sorrycause no more words or regretful touch could change the way I'm feelingYou're doing me wrong again and again you say that you will but you won't[Chorus]I stayed up late every lonely night waiting for you to call meI used to think if I gave you time ooo baby you'd find a way to make it rightYou're doing me wrong again and again you say that you will but you won't[Chorus]Don't explain and don't ask me why oh baby please stop cryingWe've been through this one too many times so baby don't you put me there againCause no matter how hard I try to believe this tiem I know that I won't[Chorus]Don't wonder why, baby don't cry, let's say goodbye
