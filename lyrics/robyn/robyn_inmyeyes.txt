Konichiwa RecordsIt's gonna be OKOKOKHey little star, don't be afraidWe all fall apart and make mistakesDon't you know nothing ever seem to make senseYou put your dancing shoes on and do it againYou know I believe it if you say you canSo when you feel like it's all pretendThen you look into my eyesJust say one true thing like you mean itAnd, baby, just look into my eyesThe sun's gonna shine on all of usWe're all the same - stardust and stuffYou're just a little boy and I'm just a little girlProgrammed rebels in a cruel, cruel worldWe never get what we deserveSo when you feel like it's all pretendThen you look into my eyesJust say one true thing like you mean itAnd, baby, just look into my eyesAnd though I bet you think it's better on the inside, there with themWe're better off outside looking back inI know you think you're lost but you think againWhen you look into my eyesOKHey little star, come take my handYou'll feel better tomorrowTomorrow I'm still your friendSo when you feel like it's all pretendThen you look into my eyesJust say one true thing like you mean itAnd, baby, just look into my eyesI bet you think it's better on the inside, there with themWe're better off outside looking back inI know you think you're lost but you think againWhen you look into my eyesOKLittle starI got youI got youYou'll be OKYou'll be OK
