This little girl didn't care what anybody saidShe got the whole world dancing to the music in her headThey loved to trash her bad, laugh at her and call her names, aah yeaAnd now they all try to copy her, isn't that a shameIt always made her stronger[Chorus:]Don't stop the musicThe world will keep turning if you use it, get out there andDon't stop the musicPeople keep dancingYou can do itBaby come onBaby come onHe knew that he was differentThis sucker couldn't winThey didn't dig his visionThey tried to fit him inBut there's no room for loosersUntil they make you changeAnd then you laugh at themTell me how much longer...[Chorus][Bridge:]You've got a perfect body, you've got a perfect smileYou're unlike anybody, got your own shine come onIf you just keep on dancing, then you won't feel no painBaby it's your decision, only you can break the chainSo all you gotta do is dance, come onMusic like love floating in the airYou can reach out grab it everywhereShowing you you're special lovedYou were put here on earth to make goodness for peopleBetter make it worth living while the world still spinning, come on!Don't stop, stop the musicThe world will keep turning if you use it, Baby come onDon't stop, stop the musicKeep on dancing, you can do itBaby come onBaby come onBaby come onDon't stop, stop the musicKeep on dancing, you can do itBaby come on
