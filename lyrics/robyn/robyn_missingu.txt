Baby, it's so weird to me now that it's overThe space where you used to beYour head on my shoulderAll of the plans we made that never happenedNow your scent on my pillow's fadedAt least you left me with somethingThere's this empty space you left behindNow you're not here with meI keep digging through a waste of timeBut the picture's incompleteThere's this empty space you left behindNow you're not here with meI keep digging through a waste of timeBut the picture's incomplete'Cause I'm missing youI miss youCan't make sense of all of the piecesOr my own delusionsCan't take all these memoriesDon't know how to use 'emThere's a slick washed up onto the beachI follow the tracesFinding clues in my pockets and opening boxesAnd going places we went, remember to forgetThinking how you have beenI turn all my sorrow into glassBut don't leave no shatterThere's this empty space you left behindNow you're not here with meI keep digging through a waste of timeBut the picture's incompleteThere's this empty space you left behindNow you're not here with meI keep digging through a waste of timeBut the picture's incomplete'Cause I'm missing youI miss you(I miss you)This part of youThis clock that stoppedThis residueIt's all I've got(I miss you)This part of youThis clock that stopped(Clock that stopped)This residue(It's all I got)It's all I've gotThere's this empty space you left behind(This part of youThis clock that stopped)I keep thinking you're still right beside me(This residueIt's all I got)You're still thereThere's this empty space you left behind(This part of youThis clock that stopped)All the love you gave, it still defines me(There's this empty space you left behindI keep thinking you're still right beside meThere's this empty space you left behindI keep thinking you're still right beside meThere's this empty space you left behindAll the love you gave, it still defines me)
