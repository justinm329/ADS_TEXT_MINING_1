There's an eclipse in your eyeWhere I used to shineEvery secret untoldIs a planet alignedDon't need prophets or preachersTo make sense of the signsWhen the buried and hiddenCan be seen by the blindYou're right,Some words are just unspokenSo right,Then it all just falls apartThe day I break your heartI caught my reflectionIn the corner of your eyeYou said "Don't even ask the question,And I won't tell the lie"Where there's no accusationThere's no need for denialAnd if you hadn't heard that whisperThere'd be no tear to wipe from your eyeYou're right,Some words are best unspokenSo right,Then it all just falls apartThe day I break your heartNever took no adviceNot the foolish, not the wiseAll the truth that I neededWas right there in your smileEvery prophecy writtenOf what's going to beAll beginnings and endings,They're about you and meYou're right,Some words are best unspokenSo right,Until it all just falls apartYou?re right,Some words are best unspokenSo right,Then it all just falls apartThe day I break your heart
