A crowd made the magic happenThe band made the music playI can close my eyes and see him thereJust like it was yesterdayIt was just another partyTill he walked in all aloneAnd I read the message in his eyesIt said: "Honey, I'll take ya home"So I took him back to my placeAnd I knew that he would stayAnd he held me and he loved meTill we loved the night awayHe was beautifulIn the daylight of the morning sunHis golden hair had come undoneSo beautifulHe touched me with his fingertipsHe bended close, I kissed his lipsSo beautifulIt was easy for me to say goodbyeWatch him walk right out the doorTellin' myself I'd forget his faceLike all the other times beforeAnd I was halfway through the afternoonWhen I knew that I was wrongHe was spinning around inside my headLike some old familiar songSo maybe some night while the music playsThough I don't know where or whenI'll be walking into some crowded roomAnd I'll see his face again
