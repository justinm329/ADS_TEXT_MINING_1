(Somthing's In The Air)I feel something in the airSomething that was never thereI feel something started to live in meSomething only God could give to meCould give to meI feel magic every whereEven though I'm supposed to careAbout all the things that my neighborsWill think of me and how I should actWhen they said what a nice girlI used to be, I used to beMy mom will say my god what've you doneI told you that boy was only a funMy daddy will raise like a storm on the seaSay now look what you've done to meEven though I care, I feel magic in the airWhat's a matter with you babyDid you fall too hard when you fall in loveYou fall in loveWhat's a matter with you babyDid you fall too hardI feel magic every whereEven though I'm supposed to careAbout all the things that my neighborsWill think of me and how I should actWhen they said what a nice girlI used to be, I used to be
