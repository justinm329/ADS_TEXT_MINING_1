A chair is still a chairEven when there's no one sitting thereBut a chair is not a houseAnd a house is not a homeWhen there's no one thereTo hold you tightAnd no one thereYou kiss good nightA room is still a roomEven when there's nothing there but roomBut a room is not a houseAnd a house is not a homeWhen the two of usAre far apartAnd one of usHas a broken heartNow and thenI call your nameAnd suddenly your face appearsBut it's just a cracy gameWhen it ends it ends in tearsDarling have a houseDon't let one mistakeKeep us apartI'm not meant to live aloneTurn my house into a homeWhen I climb the stairsAnd tur the keyOh please be thereStill in love with me
