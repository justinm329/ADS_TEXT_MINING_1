Guilty undertaker sighsLonesome organ grinder criesSilver saxophone saysThat I should wait for youThe crack bells and the washed out hornsBlowing into my face with scornThat's not the wayI wasn't born to lose youI want you, I want youI want you so badHoney I want youDrunken politicians leap upon the streetWhile mothers weepAnd saviors were fast asleepThey wait for youI wait for them to read your looksWhile drinking from my broken cupAnd ask me to open up the gate for youI want you, I want youI want you so badHoney I want youI turn to the queen of spadesAnd talk to my chambermaidShe knows I'm not afraid to look at herShe is good to meAnd there's nothing that she doesn't seeShe knows where I like to beBut it doesn't matterI want you, I want youI want you so badHoney I want youNow you're dancing childWith his Chinese suitHe spoke to me and I took his fluteI know I wasn't very cute to him was IBut I did it because you likeBecause you took him for a rideBecause the time was on his sideAnd becauseI want you, I want youI want you so badHoney I want you
