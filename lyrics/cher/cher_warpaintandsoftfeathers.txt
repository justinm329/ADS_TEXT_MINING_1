They were from two warring tribesSo their love could never beHe was a painted ApacheAnd she was a CherokeeHe was stealing her father's horsesWhen he saw her standing thereMoon braided bits of silverAll through her long black hairWar paint and soft feathersLove was meant to beEven though he was ApacheShe was a blue-eyed CherokeeWar paint and soft feathersUnder the pale moon lightDoing what tribal laws forbidAs drums brought the silence of the nightHis strong arms circled round her waistHis headband touched her browThey were of two different tonguesBut their lips met anyhowNext to a small oak treeCrossed spears forbid their loveThere'd been no peace between their tribesLong as eagles soar aboveWar paint and soft feathersLove was meant to beEven though he was ApacheShe was a blue-eyed CherokeeWar paint and soft feathersUnder the pale moon lightDoing what tribal laws forbidAs drums brought the silence of the nightNow the leaves have fallen to the groundOver and over againFrom the small oak tree grown tallerWhere once crossed spears had beenA young man rides his pinto horseAnd he stands there tall and freeThe son of a wild ApacheAnd a blue-eyed CherokeeWar paint and soft feathersLove was meant to beEven though he was ApacheShe was a blue-eyed CherokeeWar paint and soft feathersUnder the pale moon lightDoing what tribal laws forbidAs drums brought the silence of the nightWar paint and soft feathersLove was meant to beEven though he was ApacheShe was a blue-eyed CherokeeWar paint and soft feathersUnder the pale moon lightDoing what tribal laws forbidAs drums brought the silence of the night
