Children playing in a park with a ball, teddy bears,and dolls if you watch themVery close then you see there's a love for all dancing through the light musicOnly they can hear they can close their eyes knowing there's nothing to fearThey can't see a thing whistle through the trees cos' they are still childrenThey are still childrenNow their time has come and gone they are grown all to soon it seems childrenIn their land and dreams dancing through the light music that only they canHear they can close their eyes and know there's nothing to fear I wish thatTime stood still so they would never feel the pain of not being children I wishThat time stood still so they would never feel I wish that time stood still
