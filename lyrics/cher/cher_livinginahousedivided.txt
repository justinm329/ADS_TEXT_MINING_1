Look at us the picture of happinessNot so long ago, Ah, not so very long agoThe price of all our friendsThe perfect couple were weIs this how it will end?Just a sad sad story.[CHORUS:]Living in a house dividedWith a love that's so onesidedThere's no chance at allThe walls have got to fallTumbling downLook at us the King and Queen of emptinessLiving inside our castle of lonelinessUnable to make amendsSuch perfect strangers are weIs this how it will end?Just a sad story.[Repeat chorus]
