Well, hello Mr. SoulI dropped by to pick up a reasonFor the thought that I caught that my headWas the event of the seasonWhy in crowdsJust a trace of my faceCould seem so pleasin'I'll cop out to the changeBut a stranger is putting the tease onI was down on the groundWhen the messengerWrote me a letterI was raised by the praise of a fanWho said I upset herAny girl in the worldCould have easily known me much betterShe saidYou're strange, but don't changeAnd I let herIn a while when the smile on my faceTurned to plasterStick around while the clown who gets sickDoes the trick of disasterFor the race of my head and my faceIs moving much fasterIs it strange I should changeI don't knowWhy don't you ask herIs it strange I should changeI don't know, why don't you ask herIs it strange I should changeI don't know, why don't you ask herIs it strange I should changeWhy don't you ask her
