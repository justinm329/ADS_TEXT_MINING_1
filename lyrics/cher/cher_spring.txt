In a broken down apartment houseLaid a woman in laborShe said by the grace of GodI'll have this childAnd the help of a neighborSix o'clock the sun was risingAll upon the worldSeven forty-five the neighbor smiledAnd said you got a beautiful girlShe named her SpringWinter's been a long time passingShe named her SpringAnd though she's never been wedShe held her newborn child and saidAh SpringI've waited a long long time for youIn a broken down apartment houseLay a woman dyingBy her side a little six year old girlWho was softly cryingMomma don't go awayAnd leave me all aloneMomma said to the welfare ladyFind my child a good homeI miss my SpringAh winter's been a long time passingI miss you SpringThe angels came that dayThe welfare lady knelt to prayAh SpringShe'll be long time gone from youA beautiful church outside of townStands a woman smilingOn her hand is a wedding bandOf fashionable stylingAll these years in the orphan's homeHe shares with youNow all your hopes and your childhood dreamsHave all come trueHe loves you SpringWinter's been a long time passingHe needs you SpringHe promised you todayHe would never never go awayAh SpringHe's waited a long long time for youLong long time for you
