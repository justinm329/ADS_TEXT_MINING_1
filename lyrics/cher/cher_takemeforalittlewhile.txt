I've been tryingTo make you love meBut everything I tryJust takes you further from meYou don't love meSo you treat me cruelBut no matter how you hurt meI'll always be your foolIf you don't want me foreverAnd if you don't need me foreverAnd if you can't love me foreverTake me for a little whileSo I can hold you baby(For a little while)So I can make you want meI've got to stop itThere should be a lawCause every time you put me downI love you moreAnd I feel so helplessAnd it ain't funnyCause deep inside I knowYou're never gonna love me
