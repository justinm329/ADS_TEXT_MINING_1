The funny-face kid from down the streetAlways very close at handHe was just a cowboy, I was lady granBut I don't think I would have shot him downIf I knew then what I know nowHigh school days and puppy loveLearning what it's all aboutHe was kinda akward, I was filling outBut I don't think that I would have played aroundIf I knew then what I know nowToo many years, too many chairsToo many other things, too many menTime and again I had to test my wingsNo time for love, strings or wedding ringsA pretty young girl from baltimoreGot herself a real good manOnce he was a cowboy who wanted lady granAnd I know that I would have made that nowIf I knew then what I know nowOnce he was a cowboy who wanted lady granAnd I know that I would have made that vowIf I knew then what I know now
