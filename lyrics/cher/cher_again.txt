Again evening finds me at your doorHere to ask you just once moreIf we could try againI don't know quite what to sayNever was too good that waySo won't you help me againI don't know what made me leaveIf you just take me back you seeHow much I love youAgain don't stand crying in the doorIf you believe your eyes once moreYou see I'll never lie again
