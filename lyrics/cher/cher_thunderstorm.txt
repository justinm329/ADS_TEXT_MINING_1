I could pass the evening hereStaring down into your eyesJust forget there's a world somewhere outsideI kept my porch-light burningSo you could find my doorFelt so good to hear your footstepsWalk across my bedroom floorI knew that you were comingBy the thunderstorm last nightI swear I heard the north wind call your nameBut a clear sky of blue starsAnd the darling man you areMakes it feel so good lying here next to youThis dusty town has needed rainLike I've been needing youSo hold me tight as only you can doBy the light of just one candleI feel your warm hands touching meWhile our shadows move togetherIn the sweetest harmonyI knew that you were comingBy the thunderstorm last nightI swear I heard the north wind call your nameBut a clear sky of blue starsAnd the darling man you areMakes it feel so good lying here next to youI knew that you were comingBy the thunderstorm last nightI swear I heard the north wind call your nameBut a clear sky of blue starsAnd the darling man you areMakes it feel so good lying here next to you
