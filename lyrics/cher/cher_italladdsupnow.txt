The way you look at herIs the way you use to look at meWhen things were differentToo many changes have gone downStrange vibrations all aroundMakes me think perhapsOur love ain't rightSo ask your heart and soulThey will surely knowIf you still love meNo break down is too bigFor you not to digThe kind of love I'm putting downIt all adds up nowTwo and two are really fourIt all adds up nowMy heart knows the scorePut me in your loving bagPlease don't say I am a dragI gave you more than life itselfSo if you can walk awayLove will come another dayIn a new disguiseMaybe you're the kind of guyAll you want to do is make me crySometimes I wonder why today
