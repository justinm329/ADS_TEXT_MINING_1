You were the only thing I hadHow could a good love go so badSomehow I guess I should have knownThat you would leave me here aloneThey say you found somebody newBut that won't change my love for youHow could you leave me on my ownYou know I hate to sleep aloneRemember how it used to beWhen you were here with meYou were the only one I've knownAnd how I hate to sleep aloneSomeday, some way, somebody newWill make you feel the way that I doBut I just wish that you'd come homeYou know that I hate to sleep aloneBut I just wish that you'd come homeYou know that I hate to sleep alone
