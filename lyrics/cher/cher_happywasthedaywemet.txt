It hurts inside to know of all the timesWe've ever had a cryTo keep away the reasoning of why we lieIt only leads me down a lonely roadAnd strange of fates as a world toA new and different time or placeTo live away the time of day so we can raceExactly what we choose just not to believeAnd oohHappy was the day we metNever could I ever forget youI knew too well not to stayWe paid our price turn our headsClose our eyes and sacrificeExcuses of loveThat once was warm has turned to iceBut only leave me cold and so aloneNow memories of years and funCan only turn my eyes to seeAll the good that's been undoneBut I believe we're lucky just to learnFrom what we wereWhat about..oooh yeahOh oh oh yeahOh if you go awayOh, you so happy babyNow, memories of years and funCan only turn my eyes to seeAll the good that's been undoneBut I believe we're lucky just to learnFrom what we wereAnd oohHappy was the day we metNever will I ever forget youI knew too well not to stayHappy was the day we metNever could I ever forget youHappy was the day we metNever could I ever forget youHappy was the day we metNever could I ever forget you
