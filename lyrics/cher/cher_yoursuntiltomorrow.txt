Tonight I hold to nothingBut the feelings in my soulMy heart overflows with emotionsI just can't controlThere's someone you are going toBut tonight I just can't tell right from wrongLet me be yours until tomorrowLet me be yours until tomorrowGive me one night of your lifeJust be mine till the dawnTomorrow the real worldWill come crashing down on meI know I must lose youThat's the way it has to beBut tonight I see no boundariesSo I beg you before my chance is goneLet me be yours until tomorrowLet me be yours until tomorrowGive me one night of your lifeSo I can go onTill the dawn's intrusionStarts us with illusionMake believe you're mine, loveThis is not goodbye, loveAll I ask is one nightTill the morning sun lightWon't you stay here in my armsAnd babyLet me be yours until tomorrowLet me be yours until tomorrowLet me be yours until tomorrowLet me be yours until tomorrow
