Put a lid on itWhat's that you say?Put a lid on itOh man, no wayPut a lid down on it, and everything will be all right.Put a lid on itDon't hand me thatPut a lid on itI'm all right, JackPut a lid down on it, before somebody starts a fight.Say, every time I turn it loose you cats Come down and cook my gooseWhen I start I just can't stopBut if you keep this up you're gonna blow your top!Put a lid on itToo late this timePut a lid on itI've got to get what's minePut a lid down on it, and everything will be all right.Well, grab your drink and clear a space I think it's time to torch this placeNow the girl's in overdriveBut some of your pals want to stay alive!I'll put a lid on itI'll put a lid down on itSave it for another night
