When I was fiveI put on Mama's high heel shoesAnd paint my faceAnd dance across the living roomIn Ruby's placeWell the music was always playingGirls laugh while the men were sayin'Apples don't fall far from the treeHey, honey come sit on my kneeApples don't fall far from the treeAnd I remember Mama's tearsWhen they said in a few yearsI'd be something to seeAt seventeen I had me a diamondAnd a string of pearlsThe men said they preffered meTo the other girlsThey took me to the best placesBut I could read it on their facesApples don't fall far from the treeHey, honey come sit on my kneeApples don't fall far from the treeAnd I remember Mama's tearsWhen they said in a few yearsI'd be something to seeThen when Mama died I made up my mindTo get on a Greyhound , get out of this townAnd leave it all behindBut life goes onA child of three smiles up at meWhile she playsThe man I love has never heard of "Ruby's Place"When he holds her with affectionAnd he uses that old expressionApples don't fall far from the treeHey, honey come sit on my kneeApples don't fall far from the treeAnd I remember Mama's tearsWhen they said in a few yearsI'd be something to see
