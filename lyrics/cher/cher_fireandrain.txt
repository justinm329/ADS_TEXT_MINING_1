Just yesterday morning they let me know you were goneSusan the plans they made put an end to youI walked out this morning and I wrote down this songI just can't remember who to send it toI've seen fire and I've seen rainI've seen sunny days that I thought would never endI've seen lonely times when I could not find a friendBut I always thought that I'd see you againWon't you look down upon me, JesusYou've got to help me make a standYou've just got to see me through another dayMy body's aching and my time is at handAnd I won't make it any other wayOh, I've seen fire and I've seen rainI've seen sunny days that I thought would never endI've seen lonely times when I could not find a friendBut I always thought that I'd see you againBeen walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sunLord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn you head aroundWell, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to comeSweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the groundOh, I've seen fire and I've seen rainI've seen sunny days that I thought would never endI've seen lonely times when I could not find a friendBut I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, nowThought I'd see you one more time again
