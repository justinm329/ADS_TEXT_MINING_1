I've been so many places in my life and timeSung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhymeI got out my life in stagesWith ten thousand people watchingBut we're alone now I'm singing this songSinging this song for youI know your image of me is what I hope to beI've treated you unkindly but darling can't you seeThere's no one more important to meDarling can you please see through meCause we're alone nowAnd I'm singing this song for youYou taught me precious secrets of the truthWe're only nothingYou came out in front when I was hidingBut now I'm so much betterAnd if my words can come togetherListen to the melodyCause my love is in there hidingI love you in a place where there's no space or timeI love you for my life you are a friend of mineAnd when my life is overRemember when we were togetherWe were alone and I was singing this song for youSinging this song, singing this song for you
