Tonight you're mine completelyYou give your love so sweetlyTonight the light of love is in your eyesBut will you love me tomorrowIs this a lasting treasureOr a moment's pleasureShould I believe the magic of your sighWill you still love me tomorrowTonight with words unspokenYou say that I'm the only oneBut will my heart be brokenWhen the night meets the morning's sunI like to know that your loveIs a love I can be sure ofSo tell me now and I won't ask againWill you still love me tomorrowSo tell me now and I won't ask againWill you still love me tomorrowWill you still love me tomorrowWill you still love me tomorrow
