They go off and leave me behindThey have so many words to findI run to catch a glimpse of themJust walking in the sunKnowing they'll be mine againWhen the evening has begunAnd when I see them hand in handThe boy who walks beside the manI pray that I will always have the worldThat I have foundThe husband and the sonThat I built my life aroundHe'll never know of that night long agoHe'll never know it's locked in my mindNo he'll never knowFrom the feelings I showHe'll never knowHis son is only mineSometimes I lie awake at nightWatching darkest turn to lightThinking back on all the thingsI said to him todayWondering if I might had a careless word to sayWhen the morning's almost hereHe reaches out to draw me nearSilently I search his face for the loveI hope to see and once againI'm sure that all his love belongs to meHe'll never know of that night long agoHe'll never know it's locked in my mindNo he'll never knowFrom the feelings I showHe'll never knowHis son is only mine
