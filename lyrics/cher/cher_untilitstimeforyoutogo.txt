You're not a dream, you're not an angelYou're a manI'm not a queen, I'm a womanTake my handWe'll make a space in the livesThat we'd plannedAnd here we'll stayUntil it's time for you to goYes, we're different worlds apartWe're not the sameWe laughed and played at the startLike in a gameYou could have stayed outside my heartBut in you cameAnd here you'll stayUntil it's time for you to goDon't ask why of meDon't ask howDon't ask foreverLove me, love me nowThis love of mine had no beginningIt has no endI was an oak, now I'm a willowI can bendAnd though I'll never in my lifeSee you againStill, I'll stayUntil it's time for you to go
