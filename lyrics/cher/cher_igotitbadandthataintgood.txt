My baby treats me sweet and gentleThe way that he shouldI got it bad and that ain't goodMy poor heart it's sentimentalYou know it ain't made out of woodI got it bad and that ain't goodWhen the weekend is overAnd monday rolls roundI am the way that I started outYou know I'm crying, crying my heart outHe don't love me like I love himAh nobody couldI got it bad, bad,I got it bad, bad, bad, bad, badI got it bad, ah badAnd I got it bad and it ain't good
