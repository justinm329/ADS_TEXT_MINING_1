Chastity Sun, you are the oneThat can make me smileWhen I'm feeling sadYou come close to meAnd my heart goes running freeYou are the proof God livesYou are his gift to meSweet baby girlYou make my worldBright and shinning newWhen I look at youIn your eyes I seeThe world that God meant to beThere's no hate or angryJust love for humanityWe'll have children of the kingdomThey won't be torn by war, torn by hateNor will they hesitate to loveChastity Sun, we are as oneYou have come from meYou're the fruit, I'm the treeI am trying soBut I've got so far to goI've got so much to teach youAnd so much myself to knowSweet baby oneYou bring the sun in a simple wayWith the things you sayIn my smile or tearsSuch innocents in your heartYou make up God's great circleCause I am the end and you're the startWe'll have children of the kingdomThey won't be torn by warNor will they kill or hateOr hesitate to love
