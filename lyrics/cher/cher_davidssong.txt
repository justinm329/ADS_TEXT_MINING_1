Won'tcha let me rock and roll you babyI haven't seen you in a long, long timeI haven't fooled around with any candles latelyJust thought you might have some music in mindAh I just want to serenade youMaybe we could even live a verse or twoAnd I could finish this ole love songSo I could start singing it to youI could start singing it to youIf I could finish this ole love songAnd I could start singing it to youWon't you come and boogie-woogie with me babyIt's been a while since I held you close to meI haven't met many boys like you babyKnew I would find you eventuallyAh I just want to serenade youMaybe we could even live a verse or twoAnd I could finish this ole love songSo I could start singing it to youI could start singing it to youIf I could finish this ole love songAnd I could start singing it to you
