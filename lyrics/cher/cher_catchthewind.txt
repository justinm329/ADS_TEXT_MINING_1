In the chilly hours and minutesOf uncertaintyI want to beIn the warm hold ofYour love and mineTo feel you all around meAnd to take your handAlong the sandAh, but I may as well tryAnd catch the windWhen the sundown pales the skyI want hide a whileBehind your smileEverywhere I lookYour eyes I'd findFor me to love you nowWould be the sweetest thingIt would make me singAh, but I may as well tryAnd catch the windOoooooWhen rain has hungThe leaves with tearsI want you nearTo kill my fearsAnd help me to leave allMy blues behindStanding in your heartIs where I wanna beAnd long to beAh, but I may as well tryAnd catch the windOooAh, but I may as well tryAnd catch the windOoo
