The thought of loving youThe way I'm longing toA thousand hopeful dreams I've hadAre finally coming trueI use to put you on a pedal stoolWhere you became untouchableBut now we touchAnd not so much is possibleJust be near to youWould be enough for meThe many years without your loveHas been so rough on meBut now a change is taking place in meI have found someone, who's faith in meHas given me the strengthI needed so desperatelyIn my darkness, you turn on the lightMy illusions vanished over nightThe thought of loving you, is now realityThe thousand dreams I hadWe're nowhere near to how it could beFor as we melted love so beautifulI never felt so wonderfulThe thought of loving youThe way I'm longing toAnd now, right nowRight now, right now, right now
