When I think about the good love you gave to meI cry like a babyLiving without you is driving me crazyI cry like a babyLord knows now that you're not a playthingNot a toy or a puppet on a stringWhen I think about a love so sweet nowI cry like a babyEvery road is a lonely street nowI cry like a babyLord knows now that I'm not a playthingNot a toy or a puppet on a stringToday we passed on the streetAnd you just walked on byMy heart just fell to my feetAnd once again I began to cryWhen I think about the good love you gave to meI cry like a babyLiving without you is driving me crazyI cry like a babyLord knows now that you're not a playthingNot a toy or a puppet on a stringWhen I think about a love so sweet nowI cry like a babyYou left done a lot of runningI cry like a babyWhen I think about a love so sweet nowI cry like a baby
