I once held him in my armsHe said he would always stayBut I was cruelI treated him like a foolDon't you know I threw it all awayOnce I had mountainsIn the palm of my handAnd rivers that ran through everydayI must have been madI never knew what I hadUntil I threw it all awayUntil I threw it all awayLove is all there isIt makes the world go aroundLove and only loveIt can't be denyNo matter what you think about itYou can't do without itTake a tip from one who's triedSo if you find someoneGives you all his loveTake it to your heartDon't let it strayAh one thing's for certainYou're surely gonna be hurtin'If you throw it all awayIf you throw it all away
