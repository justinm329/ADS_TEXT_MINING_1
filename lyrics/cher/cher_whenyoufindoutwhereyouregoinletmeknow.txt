When you find out where you're goin'Let me knowCause I love you just enoughTo let you goWhile you're running free and clearPlease don't disappearWhen you find out where you're goin'Let me knowWhen you find out where you're goin'Count me inAnd I'll never put you downFor where you beenAnd I'll join you when you findThat peace within your mindWhen you find out where you're goin'Let me knowI'm letting go for one nightAnd I know we'll be all rightThough he may never come backWhen he leaves my bed tonightWhen you find out where you're goin'Let me knowAnd I promise I won't say I told you soAnd when the time comes that you sayYou finally found your wayThen no matter where you areBe sure I knowThen no matter where you areBe sure I know
