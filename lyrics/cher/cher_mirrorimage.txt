I get up this morning, forget about all my plansThink about my vacations with my latest manEverything I did, what I should've doneWhy I didn't stay why I didn't runOnly I hold the key to unlock the doorI might make mistakes I made them beforeThink I hear about my life as a bookThink I rather forget but they forced me to look(Mirror image, mirror image)If it isn't in black and white(It never happened)(Mirror image) Reflection of meDo you see what they want you to see?Looking at my life through mirror imageMirror imageMust I confess everything that I've done?Can't a girl go out and have herself some fun?I don't wanna be judge I don't want the blameLiving for the day is how I play the gameThere always a dream there's always a stageSomebody's looking now it's on the front pageThrough my rear view mirror I can see where I've beenI forget the beginning and I can't see the end(Mirror image, mirror image)If it isn't in black and white(It never happened)(Mirror image) Reflection of meDo you see what they want you to see?Looking at my life through mirror imageMirror imageOnly I hold the key to unlock the doorI might make mistakes I made them beforeThink I hear about my life as a bookThink I rather forget but they forced me to look(Mirror image, mirror image)If it isn't in black and white(It never happened)(Mirror image) Reflection of meDo you see what they want you to see?Looking at my life through mirror imageMirror image(Mirror image, mirror image)If it isn't in black and white(It never happened)(Mirror image) Reflection of meDo you see what they want you to see?Looking at my life through mirror imageMirror image
