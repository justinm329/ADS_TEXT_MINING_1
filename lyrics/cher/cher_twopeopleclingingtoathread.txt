Once we wake up everydayAnd smiled rememberingHow we loved the night awayNow we look for small talkWhen it's time to dim the lightThen we both pretend we're tiredWe can always love some other nightSo we wake up in the morningAnd we go our separate waysPresent in our silenceAs the music softly playsEach day like the day beforeWe tell ourselvesWe'll try once moreTo once again we lay hereBarely touching in our bedWe're just two peopleClinging to a threadAnd so we just pretend a bitAnd we never say the wordsThat spell the end of itStill we go on tryingTo fan the dying sparkAnd sometimesEven reach outFor each other in the dark
