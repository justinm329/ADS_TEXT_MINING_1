Behind the door of every house,In every street, in every townA story is unfoldingA story is unfolding of love and hateThe most of us wait of hopes and fearsOf smiles and tears of dreamsThat lies a molderingBehind the door of every house,In every street, in every townThe stage is set for playingThe stage is set for playingAnd I call crime and punch your mimeSweet romance, a rich will danceCharacters are playingBehind the door of every house,In every street, in every townThe people are a waitingThe people are a waitingTo bare and die, the years go byThe wedding spree the crueltyAnd still they go on matingAnd to the one the only oneRemember when the need of manIs greater againThe prayers take off ascendingAll filled of love to the one aboveAsking for asking for asking for asking forA happy ending a happy ending a happy ending
