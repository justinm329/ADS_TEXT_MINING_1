They say that every thing you doTurns out all wrongThat you're bound to loseAnd you love me too muchTake me alongAh baby don't ever try to close a roseAfter it blooms to the tunedOf a spring time dayIt won't work any way'cos once it knows the sun it growsAnd keeps on growingKnowing it must say goodbyeTo the field and the skySo don't you worry about meYou could never make me unhappyCause we both have been touchedBy the spring time sunWe already wonAs long as you want meI'll be right thereBut with a life time of hard timesWe gotta loveBabe we can shareAh baby don't ever try to close a roseAfter it blooms to the tunedOf a spring time dayIt won't work any way'cos once it knows the sun it growsAnd keeps on growingKnowing it must say goodbyeTo the field and the skyAh baby don't ever try to close a roseAfter it blooms to the tunedOf a spring time dayIt won't work any way'cos once it knows the sun it growsAnd keeps on growingKnowing it must say goodbyeTo the field and the sky
