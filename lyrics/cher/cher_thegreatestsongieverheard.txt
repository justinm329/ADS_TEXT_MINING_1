Now the greenest green I've ever seenWas the grass on which you laidAnd the bluest blue was in my eyesWhen you said you couldn't stayAnd the biggest lost I ever tookWas losing what we've begunAnd the greatest song I ever heardWas the one we never sungNow the reddest red I've always saidIs the sunset coming downSoon the blackest night that kills the lightIs the only thing aroundAnd the downest down I ever beenIs when I knew my race was runAnd the greatest song I ever heardWas the one we never sungTime will kill the pain they sayAnd we'll live to love another dayIf you wanna win you got to play the gameNow the greatest break came on the dayWe were standing in the rainAnd the hardest hurt I've ever knowWas when you tried to ease my painAnd the longest day in historyWaiting till my crying's doneAnd the saddest song I ever heardWas the one we finally sung
