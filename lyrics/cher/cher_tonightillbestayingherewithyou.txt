Throw my ticket out the window,Throw my suitcase out there, too,Throw my troubles out the door,I don't need them any more'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.I should have left this town this morningBut it was more than I could do.Oh, your love comes on so strongAnd I've waited all day longFor tonight when I'll be staying here with you.Is it really any wonderThe love that a stranger might receive.You cast your spell and I went under,I find it so difficult to leave.I can hear that whistle blowin',I see that stationmaster, too,If there's a poor boy on the street,Then let him have my seat'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.Throw my ticket out the window,Throw my suitcase out there, too,Throw my troubles out the door,I don't need them any more'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
