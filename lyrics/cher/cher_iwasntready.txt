Last night I was in heaven today I'm still on a cloud in his arms I was inHeaven and I didn't know what it was all about when he walked out the hurtWalked in I guess I wasn't ready for loveLast night I thought I was gain today I feel so ashamed if he only knew I needHim again he would come and ease my pain when he walked out the hurt walked inI guess I wasn't ready for loveHe said that he loved me he told me he'd protect me he told me he needed me butI was to blind to see yeah I was to blind to seeLast night I was in heaven but it was hell when he walked out the hurt walkedIn I guess that I wasn't ready for loveWasn't ready wasn't ready
