Had my share of disco nightsDid some talking, rainbow lightsEasy smile shines like goldBurning hot and turning coldLive that kind of life beforeLost the note to learn the scoreSomething tells me thatThere must be something moreThis time I'm holdin' out for loveMade up my mindI'm holdin' out for loveMister this timeI'm holdin' on, holdin' backHoldin' out for loveHad my fill of party scenesOne night stands and neon dreamsGood times, friends and fancy clothesFlashing highs and crashing lowsSo if that's what's on your mindWell I'll just take a pass this timeI believe I rather just leave it all behindThis time I'm holdin' out for loveMade up my mindI'm holdin' out for loveMister this timeI'm holdin' on, holdin' backHoldin' out for loveI need to find someoneWho'll still be holding meWhen the dance is doneThis time I'm holdin' out for loveMade up my mindI'm holdin' out for loveMister this timeI'm holdin' on, holdin' backHoldin' out for loveThis time I'm holdin' out for loveMade up my mindI'm holdin' out for loveMister this timeI'm holdin' on, holdin' backHoldin' out for loveThis time I'm holdin' out for loveMade up my mindI'm holdin' out for loveMister this timeI'm holdin' on, holdin' backHoldin' out for love
