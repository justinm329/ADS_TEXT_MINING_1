Come you masters of warYou that build all the gunsYou that build the death planesYou that build the big bombsYou that hide behind wallsYou that hide behind desksI just want you to knowI can see through your masksYou that never done nothingBut build to destroyYou play with my worldLike it's your little toyYou put a gun in my handAnd you hide from my eyesAnd you turn and run fartherWhen the fast bullets flyLike the Judas of oldYou lie and deceiveThis world war can be wonYou want me to believeBut I see through your eyesAnd I see through your brainLike I see through the waterThat runs down my drainYou can fasten the triggersFor the others to fireThen you set back and watchWhen the death count gets higherYou hide in your mansionAs the young people's bloodFlows out of their bodiesAnd is buried in the mudYou've thrown the worst fearThat can ever be hurledA fear to bring childrenInto the worldFor threatening my babyUnborn and unnamedYou ain't worth the bloodThat runs in your veinsHow much do I knowTo talk out of turnYou might say that I'm youngYou might say I'm unlearnedBut there's one thing I knowAnd I'm younger than youEven Jesus would neverForgive what you didLet me ask you one questionIs your money that goodWill it buy you forgivenessDo you think that it couldI think you will findWhen your death takes its tollAll the money you madeWill never buy back your soulAnd I hope that you dieAnd your death will come soonWell I will follow your casketIn a pale afternoonWell I'll watch while you're loweredInto your death's bedAnd I'll stand over your graveTill I'm sure that you're dead
