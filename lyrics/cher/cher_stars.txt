I was never one for saying what I really feelExcept tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's realStars they come and goThey come fastThey come slowThey go like the last light of the sunAll in a blazeAnd all you see is gloryHey, but it gets lonely hereWhen there's no one here to shareYou can shake it all away if you will hear my storySome people ask for fame like athlete's in a gameWe break our collarbones and come up swingingSome of us are downed some of us a crownedAnd some are lost and never found but most have seen it allThey live there lives in sad cafe's and music hallsThey always come up singingSome make it when they're young before the world has done its dirty jobLater on someone will say you've had your day,And now you must make wayBut they will never know the pain of livingWith a name you'd never ownOr the many years forgettingWhat you know too wellThat the ones who get the crownHave been let downYet try to make amendsWithout defendingPerhaps pretendingYou never saw the eyesOf grown men of twenty-fiveThat follow as you walkAnd ask for autographsOr kiss you on the cheekBut you never can believeThey really love youSome make it when they're oldPerhaps they have a soulThey're not afraid to bearOr perhaps there's nothing thereStars they come and goThey come fastThey come slowThey go like the last light of the sunAll in a blazeAnd all you see is gloryBut most have seen it allThey live there livesIn sad cafe's and music hallsThey always come up singingSingingSingingSinging
