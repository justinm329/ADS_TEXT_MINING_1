I see the clouds and I feel the rainIt's all coming down to you againAnd I take the ashesThough memories stays the sameIt's all coming down to love and painHeadin' for the coastTrying to make the most of this miseryCause there's a pain in my heartAnd it's tearing me apartWell I guess it comes down to loving you(do you see the clouds, can you feel the rain)It's all coming down to love and painOn the road again (thinking about you baby)Tomorrow I will play l.a.But there's a pain in my heart and it's tearing me apartWell I guess that's just the way my story goesWell there's a hunger in my veins and it's driving me insaneBut I guess it all comes down to love and painWell there's a hunger in my veins and it's driving me insaneSo won't you help, so won't you help meAh won'tcha help me, help me, help me, help meBut there's a hunger in my heart and it's tearing me apartWell I guess that's just the way my story goesAnd there's a hunger in my veins and it's driving me insaneWell I guess it comes down to loving youAh I guess it's all coming down to love and pain
