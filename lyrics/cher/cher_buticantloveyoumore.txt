More-I don't know how toMore-I die without youMore-and I would stop the world turningI stop the sun burningBut I can't love you moreMore-is there more than a lifetimeMore-count the stars in the nighttimeMore-I'm already your slave loveThat's what I gave loveAnd I can't love you moreEvery breath that I takeMy first thought when I wakeEvery song I hearHow I feel when you're nearHow I feel by your sideHow I'm glad I'm aliveWhether winter or springDoesn't mean anythingHow my home's anywhereKnowing that I know you careAnd how nothing I seeBeyond you and meMore-I don't know how toMore-I die without youMore-and I would stop the world turningI stop the sun burningBut I can't love you more
