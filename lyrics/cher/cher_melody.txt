Melody, you're my oldest friendI can talk to you what a day it's beenOut there in the mad men crushAnother days gone down in a duskMelody listen for the phoneWhile I change my clothes he knows by now I'm homeThree days waiting took its tollThis trying to stop it's crying is getting oldMelody remember long summer daysPlaying grown ups in the cityMamma said sleep sleep sleepy headsTucked in bed with your favourite dolly ohMelody with you raggedy charmsI have looked for love in a stranger's armsScared of going home of what they'll sayYou know mamma's eyes could always look right throughDaddy won't be so proud of meNo they won't understand like you Melody
