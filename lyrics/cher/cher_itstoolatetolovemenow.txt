It's too late to say you want meBut it's too lateOnce my love for you was so greatIt's too late to love me nowIt's too bad, you say you need meAh it's too badAnd I know the feeling and it's so sadIt's too late to love me nowIt's too late to love me nowDon'tcha you know how hard I've triedHold out just for youLoving you from memory day by daySomeone came into my lifeAnd turned my dreams aroundWell he's taking all the love you turned awayIt's too late to say you want meBut it's too lateOnce my love for you was so greatIt's too late to love me nowDon'tcha you know how hard I've triedHold out just for youLoving you from memory day by daySomeone came into my lifeAnd turned my dreams aroundHe's taking all the love you turned awayIt's too bad, you say you need meAnd it's too badAnd I know the feeling and it's so sadIt's too late to love me nowIt's too late to love me now
