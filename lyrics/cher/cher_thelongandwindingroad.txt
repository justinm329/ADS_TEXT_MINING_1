The long and winding roadThat leads to your doorWill never disappear oh wellI've seen the road beforeAnd it always brings me hereLeads me to your doorThe long and winding roadThat the rain washed awayThat left a pool of tearsI cried all the days.Why leave me standing hereOh let me know the wayAs many times I will amouldAnd many times I've criedAnd many times you won't knowAnd many times I've tried stillThey lead me backTo that long and winding roadThat left me standing hereA long long time agoDon't leave me standingHere take me to your door.But still they lead me backTo that long and winding roadYou left me standing hereA long long time agoOh please don't leave me here aloneTake me to your door
