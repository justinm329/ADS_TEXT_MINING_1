What'll I do, when you are far awayAnd I'm so blue what'll I doWhat'll I do when I am wonderingWho is kissing youWhat'll I doWhat'll I do with just a photographTo tell my troubles toWhen I am aloneWith all the dreams of youThat won't come trueWhat will I doWhat'll I do when you are far awayAnd I am blue what'll I do
