The fortune queen of New OrleansWas brushing her cat in her black limousineOn the backseat were scratches fromThe marks of men her fortune she had wonCouldn't see through the tinted glassShe said "Home James" and he hit the gasI Followed her to some darkened roomShe took my money, she said "I'll be with you soon"[Chorus:]Dark Lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by oneDanced to her gypsy music till her brew was doneDark Lady played black magic till the clock struck on the twelveShe told me more about me than I knew myselfShe dealt two cards, a queen and a threeAnd mumbled some words that were so strange to meThen she turned up a two-eyed jackMy eyes saw red but the card still stayed blackShe said the man you love is secretly trueTo someone else who is very close to youMy advice is that you leave this placeNever come back and forget you ever saw my face[Chorus]So I ran home and crawled in my bedI couldn't sleep because of all the things she saidThen I remembered her strange perfumeAnd how I smelled it was in my own roomSo I sneaked back and caught her with my manLaughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my handThe next thing I knew they were dead on the floorDark Lady would never turn a card up anymore[Chorus]
