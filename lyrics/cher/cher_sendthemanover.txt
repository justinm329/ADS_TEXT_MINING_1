In a rented roomAbove a Hollywood bar with my money goneThe ragged curtains blowing in the windowLying hungry and aloneWith no one to call, not even my folksFor the means to go onWondering if I lose my nerveOr answer the phoneWhen the desk clerk calls to sayA stranger's on his wayUp the stairs to share my bedWill I stay or slip awayI know an actress has to make sacrificesBut what a price to payAnd when I called my agent todayThe conversation went this waySend in anyone from Metro or WarnersLeave a call from meWell then what about Paramount or NBCYou say there's nothing todayJust an interesting gentleman callerWith a burning requestI said send the man over, I guessWith a script and the cashJust some poor white trashFrom a bayou town and a driftwood shackI was craddled by a Cajun MamaDeserted by a Cherokee dadThen at seventeen a Georgia drifter cameAnd we made it to L.A.And when I called my agent todayThe conversation went this waySend in anyone from Metro or WarnersLeave a call from meWell then what about Paramount or NBCYou say there's nothing todayJust an interesting gentleman callerWith a burning requestI said send the man over, I guessWith a script and the cashNow I hear footsteps out in the hallMama's pictures turned to the wallA young actress must give her allPay her dues, play her role
