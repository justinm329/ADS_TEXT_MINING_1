Something goes wrong,Something goes right,And it ever punishes or strokes our pride.Never stop to think how much we lose,When we pick and chose in out solitude.Sothing comes up, Something goes down,Suddenly you feel your being pushed around,And just becuse you think your losin hold,You try to take control, the stories very old.But if we ever get our minds made upAll we gotta do is love enough,Won't be long before it comes to youGiven love enough, you'll see it throughAll you gotta do is love enoughSomeone wants in, someone wants outBut doesnt anybody see beyond the clouds,Cause man you've hardly learned to speak your nameBefore your in this gameBut baby all the sameBut if we ever get our minds made upAll we gotta do is love enough,Won't be long before it comes to youGiven love enough, you'll pull it throughAll you gotta do is love enoughAll you really gotta do is love enoughWont be long before it comes to youGiven love enough, you'll see it throughAll you gotta do is love enough
