I've lost at love beforeGot mad and closed the doorBut you said child just once moreI chose you for the oneNow we're having so much funYou treated me so kindI'm about to lose my mindYou made me so very happyI'm so glad you came into my lifeThe others were untrueBut when it came to loving youI spend my whole life with youCause you came and took controlYou touched my very soulYou always showed me thatLoving you was where it's atYou made me so very happyI'm so glad you came into my lifeThank you baby, yeahI love you so much you seeEven in my dreamsI can hear youBaby I can hear you calling meI'm so in love with youAll I ever wanna do isJust thank you babyThank you babyYou made me so very happyYou made me so very happyI'm so glad you came into my lifeYou made me so very happyI'm so glad you came into my life
