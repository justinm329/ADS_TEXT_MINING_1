She's just a secretaryAt a small recording firmWhen it comes to musicThere ain't nothing she can't learnAnd everything she lives and breathesIs written on an album sleeveShe can tell you who's hotWho will make it and who will notShe loves to hear the musicShe's got every lyric downShe loves to hear them sayShe's got the greatest ears in townHangs around a studioAin't a rock star she don't knowSometimes they take her homeBut she always wakes up aloneMen that want to marry herNever satisfiedIn rythms that she hearsAll that keeps her highSo they turn around and goAnd leave her by her radioShe didn't love 'em anywayNot like she loves the men who playShe loves to hear the musicShe's got every lyric downShe loves to hear them sayShe's got the greatest ears in townShe's there at every studioThe first to come, the last to goSometimes they take her homeBut she always wakes up aloneYears will not be kind to herHer world is for the youngBands that played so tightly and knitWill soon become unstrungShe'll be just another faceOut of town and out of placeWhen the songs revive againShe'll come to life and tell them whenShe loves to hear the musicShe's got every lyric downShe loves to hear them sayShe's got the greatest ears in townShe could of been somebody's wifeMusic men destroyed her lifeEach night she took one homeBut she always woke up alone
