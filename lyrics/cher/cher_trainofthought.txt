When you're talkin' in your sleep,And the name that you whisper ain't mineAnd I've finally faced the factThat you're cheatin' on me one more timeWhen my anger starts to rumbleAnd my steam starts to riseAnd the wheels keep turningFaster as I think of all your liesOh that train of thought runnin' right on timeBut it's off the track and I'm losing my mind'Cause the way you used meGonna drive me insane honeySay you'll never leave meFor God's sake stop the trainOh the camel back is brokenBy the one extra straw added onAnd a woman can't see reasonWhen her last ray of sunshine is goneThere's a finger on the triggerAnd that locomotive soundAnd I think how much I love youAnd I turn the gun aroundOh that train of thought runnin' right on timeBut it's off the track and I'm losing my mindAnd you hold me the last timeAs I try to explain, honeyDon't feel bad about meI just had to stop this trainGotta get off, gotta get offGotta get off, gotta get off (woo-woo)Gotta get off, gotta get offThis train of thought (woo-woo)Gotta get off, gotta get off (woo-woo)Gotta get off, gotta get offThe train of thought (woo-woo)
