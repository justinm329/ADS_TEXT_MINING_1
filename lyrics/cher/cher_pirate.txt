He'll sail on with the summer windThat blows on this same dayEverybody calls him PirateDark and handsome in his own wayAnd the fire in his eyesLit all the fire inside of meAnd soon you were feelingSo much more than the wind and waves and seaPirate I'm gonna take your soulI only want the right to love youI know the sea won't let you goPirate, my love will only chain you downSo just know how much I love youAnd then turn that ship aroundEvery time that he'd sail back to meWe'd fall in love againAnd my face would fill with wonderAt all the places that he's beenBut I knew his sweetest love songWas when he heard the trade winds blowAnd I loved him way too muchTo tell the secret he should knowPirate I'm gonna take your soulI only want the right to love youI know the sea won't let you goPirate, my love will only chain you downSo just know how much I love youAnd then turn that ship aroundNow as I watch in silenceAnother young man goes to seaAnd his silhouette is stirrin' upA painful memoryAnd I know his heart is set to sailBut mine is set to cryCause I feel as the way I didThe day is Daddy said goodbyeI told himPirate I'm gonna take your soulI only want the right to love youI know the sea won't let you goPirate, my love will only chain you downSo just know how much I love youAnd then turn that ship around
