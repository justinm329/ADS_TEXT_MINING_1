You were born between a rock and a hard placeTo a couple of losersI lived on the other side of your duplexI heard you getting those bruisesI never would've wanted to walk in your shoesIt scared me to death, I was a kid tooSometimes I think about youTravis are you out there somewhereSearching for somebody to careAre you doing the same thingThat your daddy did to youWish I could have helped you somehowWonder if it's just too late nowSaw your pain, how come nobodySeemed to have a clueIs your world still black and blueTravis, TravisDid you follow in your mama's footstepsStrung out on bad thingsJust a product of circumstancesNever taught what love meansTravis I hope you did it different this timeAll you had to do was make up your mindWell, how did you decide to live your lifeTravis are you out there somewhereSearching for somebody to careAre you doing the same thingThat your daddy did to youWish I could have helped you somehowWonder if it's just too late nowSaw your pain, how come nobodySeemed to have a clueIs your world still black and blueTravis, TravisAnd the circle goes roundUntil someone hears the soundOf a breaking heartWish I could have helped you somehowWonder if it's just too lateSaw your pain, how come nobodySeemed to have a clueIs your world still black and blueTravis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis
