I should go out tonightAnd get on with my lifeBreak these chains of solitudeA little luck and a little helpI might even find myselfIn the arms of someone newBut, once you've loved somebodyIt ain't that easy to doOnce you've somebodyLike I've loved youLook what you've gone and doneYou've ruined it for anyoneWho tries to steal this heart awayI can't get you off my mindI've told myself a million timesA little time is all it takesBut, once you've loved somebodyIt ain't that easy to doOnce you've somebodyLike I've loved youI gave you everything that I had to giveI don't know if I can go that far againBut, once you've loved somebodyIt ain't that easy to doOnce you've somebodyLike I've loved youOh, once you've loved somebodyOh, like I've loved you
