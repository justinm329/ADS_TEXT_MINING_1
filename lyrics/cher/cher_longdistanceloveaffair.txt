Momma raised me to love one manAnd that's just what I'm trying to doBut since you've been playingIn that rock and roll bandI never see enough of youSaw your picture in a magazineRead the letters that you sent back homeBut of the night I'm alone by the t.v. screenListening for the telephoneLong distant love affairWe got a station to station romanceAnd while I'm here you're always thereThis kind of love don't get no whereIt's just a long distant love affairI got a fever running through my bloodNight and day you know it never failsAnd there's only one thingThat's gonna satisfy meAnd you can't send it through the mailLong distant love affairWe got a station to station romanceAnd while I'm here you're always thereThis kind of love don't get no whereIt's just a long distant love affairLong distant love affairWe got a station to station romanceAnd while I'm here you're always thereThis kind of love don't get no whereIt's just a long distant love affairLong distant love affairWe got a station to station romanceAnd while I'm here you're always thereThis kind of love don't get no whereIt's just a long distant love affair
