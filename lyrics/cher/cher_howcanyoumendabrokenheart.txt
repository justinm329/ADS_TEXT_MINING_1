I can think of younger daysWhen living for my lifeWas everything a man could want to do?I could never see tomorrowBut I was never told about the sorrowAnd how can you mend a broken heart?How can you stop the rain from falling down?How can you stop the sun from shining?What makes the world go round?How can you mend this broken man?How can a loser ever win?Please help me mend my broken heartAnd let me live againI can still feel the breezeThat rustles through the treesAnd misty memories do days gone byWe could never see tomorrowNo one said a word about the sorrowAnd how can you mend a broken heart?How can you stop the rain from falling down?How can you stop the sun from shining?What makes the world go round?How can you mend this broken man?How can a loser ever win?Please help me mend my broken heartAnd let me live again
