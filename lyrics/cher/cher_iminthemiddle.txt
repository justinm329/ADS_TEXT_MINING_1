Don't makes no differenceIf you lay down and cryYou know that you lied to meAnd if you come to meWith tears in your eyesDon't say good-byeJust leaveCause I'm in the middle of somethingI don't understandHow can my reasons for livingSlip right through my handsI'm in the middle of somethingI don't understandAnd if looks like I lose againDon't make no differenceWhat you think of meYou know that I'm restless and afraidAnd if you love meI know that you will seeYou can't keep meTo the promises that I madeCause I'm in the middle of somethingI don't understandHow can my reasons for livingSlip right through my handsI'm in the middle of somethingI don't understandAnd if looks like I lose againDon't make no differenceWhat you think about meAfter all you took me for a rideNow every night with youI still seem to findI just can't keep you satisfiedCause I'm in the middle of somethingI don't understandHow can my reasons for livingSlip right through my handsI'm in the middle of somethingI don't understandAnd if looks like I lose againCause I'm in the middle of somethingI don't understandHow can my reasons for livingSlip right through my handsI'm in the middle of somethingI don't understandAnd if looks like I lose again
