Wish I was in the land of cottonThere's a man waiting thereWho'll never be forgottenWhy did I have to goWhy did I go awayIt was early on one frosty morningI left the sleepy town I was born inI wrote a letter that said I was goingAnd I layed it beside your bedAnd now the concrete hurts my feetNew York's too big a city for meBack down south from Dixie beside youHoney is where I wanna beAnd then my cotton gown'll come tumblin' downI'll make ya feel like a hell of a manI wanna be held tight in your arms tonightIn my sweet old Dixie landDarling it seems like foreverDoes the Mississippi still run freeI miss a little bit of HeavenAnd your southern hospitalityThese neon lights drive me crazyI wanna lay next to you and be lazyWhere the sweet magnolia blossomsIn the early morning Georgia airTonight it looks like snowBut this Gray Hound's starting to rollI gonna be whistelin' DixieAll the way back home to you
