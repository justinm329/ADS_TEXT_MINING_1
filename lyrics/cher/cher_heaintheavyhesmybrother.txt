The road is long, with many a winding turnThat leads us to who knows where, who knows whereBut I'm strong, strong enough to carry himHe ain't heavy - he's my brotherSo on we go, his welfare is my concernNo burden is he to bare, we'll get thereFor I know he would not encumber meHe ain't heavy - he's my brotherIf I'm laden at all, I'm laden with sadnessThat everyone's heart isn't filled with gladness of love for one anotherIt's a long long road from which there is no returnWhile we're on our way to there, why not shareAnd the load, it doesn't weigh me down at allHe ain't heavy - he's my brotherHe ain't heavy - he's my brother, he's my brother, he's my brother
