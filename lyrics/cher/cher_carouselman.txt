I had a taste of bitter lifeAt sweet sixteenI was growing up too fastIf you know what I meanMet an older manWho taught me his own way to liveAnd all I had to do to keep himWas to give and giveThe carousel manKept me going around and roundCarousel man always knowThat I'd stay aroundThe carousel manWouldn't let me off his merry-go-roundI followed him around in traveling showsAlong the main county linesWatching him drinking his mind awayNot ever knowing my name at timeEach night when the show closed downHe used to tell me of his dreamsHe was wearing new French suitsWhile I mended my torn jeansThe carousel manKept me going around and roundCarousel man always knowThat I'd stay aroundThe carousel manWouldn't let me off his merry-go-roundThen one night in Santa FeThe horses stop going aroundThere he was my poor rich manLying on the Mexico groundAll the sad music of his lifeIs still spinning in my mindThe carousel starts up againAnd I found my place in lifeThe carousel manKept me going around and roundCarousel man always knowThat I'd stay aroundThe carousel manWouldn't let me off his merry-go-roundThe carousel manKept me going around and roundCarousel man always knowThat I'd stay aroundThe carousel manWouldn't let me off his merry-go-round
