Every mornin' many late night loversWake up to become early mornin' strangersThings always look different in the light of dayEvery mornin' many late night loversJust silently stare, seein' all the changesIt's hard to make small talkWhen there's nothin' to sayEarly mornin' strangersLookin' at each otherThat is all we are to one anotherEarly mornin' strangersWho wake up to discoverIt's just no good without loveTo live without love is no life at allSomewhere babyThere's got to be moreSomewhere baby there's a life worth livin'Where nobody takes more than they are givin'Where love is foreverNot just for a dayEarly mornin' strangersLookin' at each otherThat is all we are to one anotherEarly mornin' strangersWho wake up to discoverIt's just no good without loveTo live without love is no life at allBye bye babyI hope you find your loveAnd I hope I find mineI hope you find your loveAnd I hope I find mine
