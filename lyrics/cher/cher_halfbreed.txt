My father married a pure CherokeeMy mother's people were ashamed of meThe indians said I was white by lawThe White Man always called me "Indian Squaw"[Chorus:]Half-breed, that's all I ever heardHalf-breed, how I learned to hate the wordHalf-breed, she's no good they warnedBoth sides were against me since the day I was bornWe never settled, went from town to townWhen you're not welcome you don't hang aroundThe other children always laughed at me "Give her a feather, she's a Cherokee"[Repeat Chorus]We weren't accepted and I felt ashamedNineteen I left them, tell me who's to blameMy life since then has been from man to manBut I can't run away from what I am[Repeat chorus]
