Lord I haven't ask for anythingIn such a long, long timeNot since that brand new party dressWhen I was eight or nineAnd I know the world's in such a stenchYou got a lot to doBut if you ever find yourselfWith a minute or twoWon'tcha pleaseMake the man love meAh make the man seeI'd be so good for himIf he'd start letting meCome on nowMake the man love meAh make the man careJust open up his heart, LordAnd I'll take it from thereLord I know that he needs meIt's just he don't knowAnd my heart so full of himIt's gonna overflowAnd so if you should have a miracleYou wanna do up rightAh won'tcha take him by the handAnd show him the lightWon'tcha you pleaseMake the man love meAh make the man seeI'd be so good for himIf he'd start letting meCome on nowMake the man love meAh make the man careJust open up his heart, LordAnd I'll take it from thereOh I want himLord how I want himTo make some love to meWon'tcha make him seeHow sweet it could beSo come on come on now
