Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are callingFrom glen to glen, and down the mountain sideThe summer's gone, and all the roses are dyingIt's you, It's you must go and I must bideBut come ye back when summer's in the meadowOr when the valley's hushed and white with snowFor I'll be here in sunshine or in shadowOh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you soBut when ye come and all the flowers are a dyingAnd if I am dead, dead I well may beJust come and find, find the placeFind the place where I lay lyingAnd kneel and say an "Ave" there for meAnd I will hear tho soft you tread above meAnd my grave, my grave warmer and sweeter beFor you're gonna kneel and you're gonna tellGod you're gonna tell me how you loved meAnd I will sleep in peace until you come to me
