I turn my back on himNow it's you that makes me smileBut in your arms, I'm restlessLike I'm leaving in awhileI let the match and burned my bridgesYou were mineNow I got this feelingYou'll be the next in lineLiving on the love of another man's womanThat's loving on borrowed timeLike to make a song last foreverBut the next dance won't be mineLiving on the love of another man's womanThat's loving on borrowed timeMy old love's broken piecesAnd I ain't met the newYou're here in the middleHanging on until I doCause I'm a train that stopsAt every station down the lineYou're a fool so desperateThat you'll ride on borrowed timeLiving on the love of another man's womanThat's loving on borrowed timeLike to make a song last foreverBut the next dance won't be mineLiving on the love of another man's womanThat's loving on borrowed timeLiving on the love of another man's womanThat's loving on borrowed timeLike to make a song last foreverBut the next dance won't be mineLiving on the love of another man's womanThat's loving on borrowed timeLiving on the love of another man's womanThat's loving on borrowed timeLike to make a song last foreverBut the next dance won't be mineLiving on the love of another man's womanThat's loving on borrowed time
