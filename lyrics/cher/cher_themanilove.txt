Someday he'll come alongThe man I loveAnd he'll be big so big and strongThe man, the man that I loveAnd when he comes my wayI'll do my best to make him stayHe's gonna look at me and smileI'll understandAnd in a little whileHe's gonna grab, he's gonna grab my handAnd though I know it seems obscureI know it won't sayWe won't say a word[Chorus:]Maybe I shall meet him sundayMaybe monday maybe notStill I'm gonna meet him one dayCause maybe tuesday will beMy good news dayHe'll build a little home meant just for 2From which I'll never, never run with youAnd so all else aboveI'm waiting for the man I loveHe's gonna look at me and smileI'll understandAnd in a little whileHe's gonna grab, he's gonna grab my handAnd though I know it seems obscureI know it won't sayWe won't say a word[Chorus]
