Here it is again Monday morningAnd I really got the bluesBut it don't much matterI got no need to smileAnd I don't think I will for quit awhileSo it might as well stay Monday from now onCause it seems that the only one I ever love is goneAnd it just might as well stay Monday from now onGo away mister sun I can't use youBrighten someone else's lifeLet the darkest hide me and carry off my painFor there's nothing you can do, nothing you can do,Nothing you can do to make things changeSo it might as well stay Monday from now onCause it seems that the only one I ever love is goneAnd it just might as well stay Monday from now onLet the darkest hide me and carry off my painFor there's nothing you can do, nothing you can do,Nothing you can do to make things changeAnd it might as well stay Monday from now onMight as well stay Monday from now on
