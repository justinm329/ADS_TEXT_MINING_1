You ask how much I needed youMust I explainI need you oh my darlingLike roses need rainYou ask how long I'll love youI'll tell you trueUntil the twelfth of neverI'll still be loving youHold me closeNever let me goHold me closeMelt my heartLike April's snowI love youTill the blue bells forget to bloomI love youTill the clover has lost its perfumeI love youTill the poets run out of rhymesUntil the twelfth of neverAnd that's a long, long timeUntil the twelfth of neverAnd that's a long, long timeUntil the twelfth of neverAnd that's a long, long time
