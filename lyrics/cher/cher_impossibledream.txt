To dream the impossible dreamTo fight the unbeatable foeTo bear with unbearable sorrowTo run where the brave dare not goTo right the unrightable wrongTo love pure and chaste from afarTo try when your arms are too wearyTo reach the unreachable starsThis is my quest, to follow that starNo matter how hopeless, no matter how farTo fight for the right without question or pauseTo be willing to march into hell for a heavenly causeAnd I know if I'll only be true to this glorious questThat my heart will lie peaceful and calmWhen I'm laid to my restAnd the world will be better for thisThat one man scorned and covered with scarsstill strove with his last ounce of courageTo reach the unreachable star
