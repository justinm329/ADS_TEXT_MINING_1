The night is bitterThe stars have lost their glitterThe wind blows colderAnd suddenly you're olderAnd all because of the man that got awayNo more is he the causeThe writings on the wallOh but dreams, yeah dreamsHave all gone astrayThe man that won youHas gone off and undone youThe great beginningHas seen it's final endingDon't know what happenedIt's all a crazy gameNo more, no more of that ole time thrillHoney you been through the millNever will a new love will be the sameGood riddance ah goodbyeEvery, every prickle is you own toBut fools will be foolsAnd where he goes toThe road gets rougherIt's lonelier and it's tougherWe hope you run upTomorrow, tomorrow may come upThere's just no letterThe live long night and dayEver since this world begunThere ain't nothing sadderThan a one man womanCrying for the man that got away
