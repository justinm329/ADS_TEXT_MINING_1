Lay baby layLay across my big brass bedLay baby layLay across my big brass bedWhatever colors you have in your mindI gonna show them to youAnd I'll make them shineLay baby layLay across my big brass bedStay baby stayStay with your woman awhileTill the break of dayLet me see you make me smileYour clothes are dirtyBut your hands are cleanAnd you're the best thingThat I ever seenStay baby stayStay with your woman awhileWhy wait any longerFor the world to beginYou can have your cakeAnd eat it tooWhy wait any longerFor the one you loveWhen she standing in front of youSo stay baby stayStay across my big brass bedLay baby layLay while the night is still aheadI long to see you in the morning lightI want to reach for you in the nightSo stay baby stayStay across my big brass bedLay baby layLay while the night is still aheadAh lay baby layLay across my big brass bed
