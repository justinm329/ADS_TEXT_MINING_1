It was Friday nightAnd both of us were lonelyWe seemed to meet as lonely people doI filled that empty space till Monday morningI never meant ton fall in love with youCame right out and told meAbout your wife back home in HoustonYou were just in town on businessYou never tried to lead me onTime had seemed just fineSimply love you for the momentHeaven help me time ran outNow the moment's goneSilver wings and golden ringsAre taking you todayAnd I'll be dying on the groundWhile you are flying awaySilver wings and golden ringsAre shinning on and onWhile the only loveI've ever known is goneYou made me feel likeI was something specialThe way no other man ever doneAnd I knew last nightWould have to last foreverIt's just no way of holding back the sunAnd now I guess it's time for meTo drive you to the airportHold back all my tearsTell you it's been niceIf you come back to town againKnow I love to see youRemember I'm not strong enoughTo let go of you twice
