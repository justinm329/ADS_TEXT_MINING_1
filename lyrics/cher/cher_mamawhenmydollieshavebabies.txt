Mama when my dollies have babiesAnd I am a big ladyMama will a prince come and take me awayWhen I said these things I believed in kingsThen I didn't know love could hurt me soSlowly she replied, tears had filled her eyesBaby not so fast let your young life lastMama when my dollies have babiesAnd I am a big ladyMama will a prince come and take me awayI sang to her in fun, my teens had just beganMy age was not the same still we played the gameHer eyes were filled with pride and slowly she repliedSoon enough you'll be a very pretty brideMama when my dollies have babiesAnd I am a big ladyMama will a prince come and take me awayMama, will the hurt go away deep insideWhen I sang this songMy poor world had gone alongAll my early dreams has turned to crystal streamsMy love it was last and more tears have pastAnd left me just one thing a tender voice I singMama when my dollies have babiesAnd I am a big ladyMama will a prince come and take me away
