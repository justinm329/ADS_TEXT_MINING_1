When I was a little girl in DixieI used to chase the firefliesThen I grew up and started chasing the guysTeenage romance what just the thingTill I got in a family wayNow mama only working in a cheap cafeWaiting on tables and passing myself aroundDixie girl, you're the small talkIn a small talking townI fall in love every day with someoneWho ends up just driving awayWhile I dreaming I with himGoing down that west bound highwayOne night a man walks in and smilesAnd orders coffee blackTook me for a ride in his brand new cadillacTold me he loved me with all his heartI told him I loved him tooHe said goodbye Dixie, I'll be back for youWaiting on tables and passing myself aroundDixie girl, you're the small talkIn a small talking townI fall in love every day with someoneWho ends up just driving awayWhile I dreaming I with himGoing down that west bound highwayNow all I do is read thoseHollywood photograph magazinesWork my shifts for tipsAnd live alone in my dreamsI'm a Dixie girl who praysSome day she'll be a Delta queenFind a good man,Who'll raise me and my babyWaiting on tables and passing myself aroundDixie girl, you're the small talkIn a small talking townI fall in love every day with someoneWho ends up just driving awayWhile I dreaming I with himGoing down that west bound highway
