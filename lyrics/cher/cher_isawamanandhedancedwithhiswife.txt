I was by myself drinkin'Chilled lonely wineThen he walked in with some womanWho's place was once mineAnd she wore his ring on her fingerAnd the band began a songI heard before[Chorus:]I saw a man and he danced with his wifeHow I wished he was dancin' with me'Cause I remember beforeWhen we danced on this floorHis eyes were only on meWhere did I go wrong?They were playin' our songWhile I was cryin' all night longI kept watchin' as they danced slowly byI kept hopin', kept on lookin'But I couldn't catch his eyeOh, then he got up, and he saw meBut he just walked right on byAnd danced with her[Chorus]Two weeks later, I heard a knock on my doorHe was backJust like all those good times beforeAw, then he kissed meAnd he told meI left her 'cause I love youSo much more than I knewI saw a man and he danced with his wifeBut now he's dancin' with meI remember before, when we danced on this floorHis eyes were only on me[repeat to fade]
