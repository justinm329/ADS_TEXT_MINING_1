When I said I needed youYou said you would always stayIt wasn't me who changed but youAnd now you've gone awayDon't you see that now you're goneAnd I'm left here on my ownThat I have to follow youAnd beg you to come homeYou don't have to say you love meJust be close at handYou don't have to stay foreverI will understandBelieve me believe meI can't help but love youBut believe I will never tie you downLeft alone with your memoryLive seems dead and so do weAll that left is lonelinessThere's nothing left to feelYou don't have to say you love meJust be close at handYou don't have to stay foreverI will understandBelieve me believe meI can't help but love youBut believe I will never tie you downYou don't have to say you love meJust be close at handYou don't have to stay foreverI will understandBelieve me believe meI can't help but love youBut believe I will never tie you down
